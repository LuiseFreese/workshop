# What are components?

Power Apps components are reusable building blocks that allow you to create modular, maintainable, and consistent UI elements across multiple screens or apps. Instead of copying and pasting controls, you can define a component once, such as a custom header, navigation menu, or input form, and use it wherever needed. This reduces duplication, simplifies updates, and speeds up development.

You should use components to streamline your app design, enforce UI consistency, and make your apps easier to manage and scale. Theyâ€™re especially useful in team environments or when maintaining multiple apps with similar layouts or behaviors.

Components are stored in two ways:

* App-specific components live only within the app where they're created
* Library components are saved in a central component library, allowing you to share and reuse them across multiple apps

Using component libraries helps standardize development across projects and enables easier collaboration in Power Platform solutions.
